# Daily-Activity-Analysis-with-Fitbit-Tracker-Data
This is my individual project for the course Digital Health and Human Behavior (2025). The course consisted of weekly programming assignments and project work. This project was graded 37/40 and I received the highest grade 5 for the course.

The aim of this project was to analyze daily activity data collected with a Fitbit activity tracker and to study the behavioral patterns of 30 volunteer users in terms of physical activity, sleep, and energy consumption over a period of 31 consecutive days. The project utilized a Fitbit dataset available on Kaggle, which was preprocessed by removing missing values and inconsistencies, after which the data was analyzed at both the group and individual levels using descriptive statistical methods, visualizations, and clustering. The main objective of the analysis was to assess users' lifestyles and compare them with the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for physical activity and sleep, as well as to identify recurring activity and behavior profiles. The learning objectives of the project were to develop skills in the pre-processing of real sensor data, the justified selection of analysis methods, the interpretation of results, and the critical evaluation of data limitations and opportunities for further research.
